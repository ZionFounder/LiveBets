    <h2>🧠 About Us</h2>
    <p>24/7 Live Games is an unpredictable, high-energy livestream betting platform built for entertainment, community, and deflationary crypto economics. This isn’t just a game — it’s an experiment in building something real, raw, and rewarding from the ground up.</p>
    <p>We’re not launching with studio lighting and million-dollar sets. We’re starting this in a room, with makeshift props, DIY games, and a big vision. Over time, with the community’s support, we’ll grow this into a full-blown livestreaming production — with custom game setups, studio-grade streaming, and a vibrant ecosystem that gives back.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re watching, betting, or just vibing with the chat, you’re part of something we’re building together — from scratch.</p>
